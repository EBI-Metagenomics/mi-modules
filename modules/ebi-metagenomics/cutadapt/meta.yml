        List of at most two primer fasta files
        The first file should be the forward strand
        The second file should be the reverse strand
        If you only want to trim a primer from one strand,
        then use an empty file as a standin for the second
        e.g. `[ path/to/fwd_primer, empty.txt ]` for only using
        the forward priemer
